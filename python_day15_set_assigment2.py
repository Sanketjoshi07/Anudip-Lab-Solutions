'''
2. Write a Python program to Return a set of elements present in Set A or B, but not both.

 Input: set1 = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50} set2 = {30, 40, 50, 60, 70} 

Output: {20, 70, 10, 60}



'''

# Define the sets
set1 = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}
set2 = {30, 40, 50, 60, 70}

# Get elements in either set but not both
exclusive_elements = set1.symmetric_difference(set2)

# Print the result
print(exclusive_elements)

# Ans
#Output: {10, 20, 60, 70}
